# Book-Dataset-Visualization-System
This project is based on using data visualization tools i.e. Tableau to display useful visuals and storing the data for better analysis and processing. Create a story line to show how computing and visualization can help organization or individual for the benefit of analytics and business. Story lines provide useful insights that were not visible in raw data. Book dataset visualization system will be useful to any type of consumer who is interested in getting pattern or some insightful data for books. Users can filter out which part of the data they want to analyse by filters.
